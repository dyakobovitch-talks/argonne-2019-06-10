    "Now, you're going to practice working in Pandas. You'll walk through instantiating a `DataFrame`, reading data into it, looking at and examining that data, and then playing with it. We'll be using the data in the `data` folder located within this directory (it's the same wine data that we looked at during lecture). Typically, we use IPython notebooks like this for a very specific set of things - presentations and EDA. Now, as we'll be playing around with `Pandas`, much of what we'll be doing is considered EDA. Therefore, by using a notebook, we'll get a tighter feedback loop with our work than we would trying to write a script. But, in general, **we do not use IPython notebooks for development**. \n",

    "### Part 1 - The Basics of DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off by following the general workflow that we use when moving data into a DataFrame: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Importing Pandas\n",
    "    * Reading data into the DataFrame\n",
    "    * Getting a general sense of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks, right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import pandas\n",
    "2. Read the wine data into a DataFrame. \n",
    "3. Use the `attributes` and `methods` available on DataFrames to answer the following questions: \n",
    "    * How many rows and columns are in the DataFrame?\n",
    "    * What data type is in each column?\n",
    "    * Are all of the variables continuous, or are any categorical?\n",
    "    * How many non-null values are in each column?\n",
    "    * What are the min, mean, max, median for all numeric columns?"

    "\n",

    "1. Grab the first 10 rows of the `chlorides` column. \n",

    "4. Grab all rows where the `chlorides` value is less than 0.10. \n",
    "5. Now grab all the rows where the `chlorides` value is greater than the column's mean (try **not** to use a hard-coded value for the mean, but instead a method).\n",
    "6. Grab all those rows where the `pH` is greater than 3.0 and less than 3.5. \n",
    "7. Further filter the results from 6 to grab only those rows that have a `residual sugar` less than 2.0. "

    "Now that you've worked on all the basics with one data set, it's time to do it with a second! This time, though, you'll go through the process of downloading the data set yourself. You'll also go through the process of learning to ask questions of the data (i.e. you won't be given any questions). We'll point you to a number of different data sets, and let you go at it. In reality, this is often how data science works. There isn't a clear-cut set of instructions on what to do - you kind of just dive into the data and see what you find!\n",
